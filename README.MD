INFO: This is my project for a Intro to Wev Dev class. It details a brief introduction,
a work section, a classes section, a skills section, a project section, and a contact
form section.

RUN: Simply host the index.html page, if using VS Code just select open this folder,
you should see images, index, and other files at the top of the folder. Otherwise
this site is hosted on Github Pages.

OUTSIDE SOURCES:
BootStrap: https://getbootstrap.com/ Styling, Carousel, and Form Elements
Accordian: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_accordion Used same structure, most sources I found had close to the same structure, a select by classname, a loop, event listeners, toggle active, and grabbing the next element and chnaging it's height or display value.
Skill Bar: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_skill_bar.asp
Carousel: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/carousel/ Used the same structure as the example.
NavBar Toggle: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39903036/open-close-sidenav-bar-same-button Same setup for toggling where the size of the sidebar is found then close or open based on that size.
